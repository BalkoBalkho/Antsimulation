TO build i woud recommend using Cmake. This is for windows only.

download this https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.2/ depending on your compiler. I used visual studio and mingw windows is untested.
simply copy the SFML direcoty here. rename it to SFML-2.6.2-win. 
open this directory under microsoft visual studio, visual studio should detect the CMakeLists.txt file and ask if you want to open it.
Then just build it. It should work.
